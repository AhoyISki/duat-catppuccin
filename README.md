# Duat Catppuccin

This is an implementation of the [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) 
colorschemes for Duat.

When you `plug` this plugin, four colorschemes will be added to Duat:

* `catppuccin-latte`;
* `catppuccin-`frappe`;
* `catppuccin-macchiato`;
* `catppuccin-mocha`;

This plugin lets you use its colors to modify other `Form`s with the 
`Catppuccin::modify` function. It also has a `no_background` function, if you 
don't want the background to change.
